# Project Overview
## Objective:
Analyze the dataset of over 5,000,000 commercial airline flights in 2015 to identify patterns in flight delays, cancellations, and airline reliability. This report will provide insights and recommendations based on the data.

# Specific Objectives:
- Determine how the overall flight volume varies by month and by day of the week.
- Calculate the percentage of flights that experienced departure delays in 2015 and the average delay time.
- Analyze the variation in delayed flights throughout the year, with a focus on flights departing from Boston (BOS).
- Identify the number of flight cancellations in 2015 and the reasons for these cancellations, including weather and airline-related issues.
- Evaluate which airlines are most and least reliable in terms of on-time departures.

# Approach to the Challenge
## Data Exploration and Analysis:
### Import and Explore the Dataset: Understand its structure and contents.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies.
Create New Columns: Add columns for delay calculations, day of the week, and month.
### Initial Data Exploration:
Key Columns Identification: Focus on airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport, flight distance, scheduled/actual departure, and arrival times.
Replace Values: Clean up missing values and ensure consistency.
### Data Modelling:
Calendar Creation: Derive month, day, and year from the date data.
Baseline Comparison: Compare current traffic volume to the baseline period (February 1 to March 15, 2020).
### Trend Analysis:
Plot Monthly Traffic Volume Percentages: Visualize trends over time.
Identify Key Periods: Focus on significant declines and recoveries.
Analyze Impact of Major Events: Consider the effect of lockdowns and travel restrictions.
### Geospatial Visualization:
Dynamic Maps Creation: Show traffic changes by region and month.
Highlight Significant Changes: Identify airports with notable traffic volume fluctuations.

# Reporting and Insights:
Summarize Key Findings: Present insights from trend analysis and geospatial visualization.
Discuss Implications: Evaluate the impact on airport operations and planning.
Provide Recommendations: Offer strategies for managing future disruptions.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted airport traffic volumes, underscoring the need for resilient and flexible airport operations. This analysis provides valuable insights into traffic trends and offers recommendations for future challenges, enhancing understanding through dynamic geospatial visualization and supporting data-driven decision-making.
